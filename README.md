# Careers in Computer Science: Video Game Developer

## 1.1 Basics

### Description of Career and Responsibilities
Video game developers work in teams to plan, design, produce, debug, and maintain video games. They create everything that is part of a game from visual and audio content to the game’s features and functionality. Oftentimes, video game developers work with other people, which requires them to have a strong ability to collaborate well with others. 

**A general outline of a Game Project includes: **

* **Planning** a game's storyline, characters, environment, activities, etc. 
* Work with visual designers to **create 2D and 3D visuals models** and game assets
* **Testing and debugging** a game using automated testing tools
* Create **new features and continuously improving the game**. This may include adding add-ons, game packs, and updates.

### Required Education
Video game developers commonly require a bachelor’s degree in game development, computer science, or game design. Through a undergraduate degree, video game designers should become proficient in some programming languages such as java, C# or C++. A master’s degree in these areas can help video game developers stand out and advance to lead developer positions.

**First Year Program Courses**

**`CS 135 - Designing Functional Programs`**
> An introduction to the fundamentals of computer science through the application of elementary programming patterns in the functional style of programming. Syntax and semantics of a functional programming language. Tracing via substitution. Design, testing, and documentation. Linear and nonlinear data structures. Recursive data definitions. Abstraction and encapsulation. Generative and structural recursion. Historical context.

**`MATH 135 - Algebra`**
> An introduction to the language of mathematics and proof techniques through a study of the basic algebraic systems of mathematics: the integers, the integers modulo n, the rational numbers, the real numbers, the complex numbers and polynomials.

**`MATH 137 - Calculus 1`**
> Absolute values and inequalities. Sequences and their limits. Introduction to series. Limits of functions and continuity. The Intermediate Value theorem and approximate solutions to equations. Derivatives, linear approximation, and Newton's method. The Mean Value theorem and error bounds. Applications of the Mean Value theorem, Taylor polynomials and Taylor's theorem, Big-O notation. Suitable topics are illustrated using computer software.

**`CS 136 - Algorithm Design and Data Abstraction`**
> This course builds on the techniques and patterns learned in CS 135 while making the transition to use an imperative language. It introduces the design and analysis of algorithms, the management of information, and the programming mechanisms and methodologies required in implementations. Topics discussed include iterative and recursive sorting algorithms; lists, stacks, queues, trees, and their application; abstract data types and their implementations.

**`MATH 136 - Linear Algebra 1`**
> Systems of linear equations, matrix algebra, elementary matrices, computational issues. Real n-space, vector spaces and subspaces, basis and dimension, rank of a matrix, linear transformations, and matrix representations. Determinants, eigenvalues and diagonalization, applications.

**`MATH 138 - Calculus 2`**
> Introduction to the Riemann integral and approximations. Antiderivatives and the fundamental theorem of calculus. Change of variables, methods of integration. Applications of the integral. Improper integrals. Linear and separable differential equations and applications. Tests for convergence for series. Binomial series, functions defined as power series and Taylor series. Vector (parametric) curves in R2. Suitable topics are illustrated using computer software.
