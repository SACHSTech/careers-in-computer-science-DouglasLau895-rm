# Careers in Computer Science

## Video Game Developer

### Description of Career and Responsibilities
Video game developers work in teams to plan, design, produce, debug, and maintain video games. They create everything that is part of a game from visual and audio content to the game’s features and functionality. Oftentimes, video game developers work with other people, which requires them to have a strong ability to collaborate well with others. 

**A general outline of a Game Project includes: **

* **Planning** a game's storyline, characters, environment, activities, etc. 
* Work with visual designers to **create 2D and 3D visuals models** and game assets
* **Testing and debugging** a game using automated testing tools
* Create **new features and continuously improving the game**. This may include adding add-ons, game packs, and updates.

### Required Education
Video game developers commonly require a bachelor’s degree in game development, computer science, or game design. Through a undergraduate degree, video game designers should become proficient in some programming languages such as java, C# or C++. A master’s degree in these areas can help video game developers stand out and advance to lead developer positions.
